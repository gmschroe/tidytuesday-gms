### Week 25: UFO Sightings

I visualised when UFO sightings occur during the day and year. In the US, sightings tend to occur during the last few hours (during summer) or several hours (during winter) of the day, and sightings are especially common on Jan. 1 and July 4. The seasonal time-of-day variability in sightings may be because sightings tend to occur during dusk or the first part of the night.

Polar coordinates are used to place the days of the year on a circle, creating a donut shape. Sightings are more frequent during the last few hours (during summer) or several hours (during winter) of the day, and sightings are especially common on Jan. 1 and July 4.'>

Each chart shows sightings that occurred during a different time of day: dawn, day, dusk, or night. Sightings occur more frequently during dusk and the first part of the night.'>

Fewer UFO sightings were reported in the United Kingdom, but there are still some interesting trends:

### Week 22: Verified Oldest People

I visualised the years the oldest men and women lived and highlighted the people who set record ages.

<img src='plots/2023_wk22_female_age.png?' width = 750 alt = "Visualisation of the lives of the 100 verified oldest women who have ever lived. The dates each woman lived are plotted versus their ages on each date, creating 100 diagonal lines representing the 100 lives. The lines of the two women who set record ages (at the time of their death) are highlighted in blue. The oldest women who ever lived is Jeanne Calment, who died in 1997 at 122 years old.">

<img src='plots/2023_wk22_male_age.png?' width = 750 alt = "Visualisation of the lives of the 100 verified oldest men who have ever lived. The dates each man lived are plotted versus their ages on each date, creating 100 diagonal lines representing the 100 lives. The lines of the six men who set record ages (at the time of their death) are highlighted in purple. The oldest man who ever lived is Jiroemon Kimura, who died in 2013 at 116 years old.">
